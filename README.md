3. Start development mode by running the `npm start` command.
4. Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. This

## How to Use the Project

### Deploy

The production version of the project will be automatically linted, built and
deploy to GitHub Pages, in the `gh-pages` branch, every time it is updated
branch `main`. For example, after a direct push or an accepted pull request. For
this it is necessary to edit the `homepage` field in the `package.json` file,
replace `your_username` and `your_repo_name` with your own, and push the changes
to GitHub.

### Deployment status

The deployment status of the latest commit is displayed with an icon next to its
ID.

- **Yellow color** - the project is being built and deployed.
- **Green color** - deployment completed successfully.
- **Red color** - an error occurred during linting, build or deployment.

More detailed information about the status can be viewed by clicking on the
icon, and in drop-down window to follow the link `Details`.

## How it works

![How it works](./assets/how-it-works.png)

1. After each push to the `main` branch of the GitHub repository, a special
   script (GitHub Action) from `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file.
2. All repository files are copied to the server where the project is
   initialized and passes linting and assembly before deployment.
3. If all steps were successful, the assembled production version of the project
   files goes to the `gh-pages` branch. Otherwise, in the execution log The
   script will indicate what the problem is.
